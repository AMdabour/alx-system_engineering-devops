# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - "Traffic Tango"

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** November 10, 2023, 14:30 - 17:45 (UTC)
- **Impact:** Users experienced a rollercoaster ride in response times, featuring thrilling peaks and unexpected drops, with intermittent service unavailability for 40% of our audience on the online streaming platform.
- **Root Cause:** Our servers decided to show off their dance moves in an unscheduled "Traffic Tango," thanks to a misconfigured load balancing algorithm.

## Timeline:
- **14:30 (UTC):** Our monitoring system did the digital equivalent of clearing its throat loudly - alerting us to increased latency.
- **14:35 (UTC):** Our engineers, fueled by caffeine and determination, were shaken awake by the alert.
- **14:40 (UTC):** We dove into server logs, suspecting mischief; turned out it was just a latency party.
- **15:00 (UTC):** Convinced the database was throwing a tantrum, we summoned the Database Ops team. They found no drama; the database was innocent.
- **15:30 (UTC):** Escalated to the Infrastructure team. Investigated wild paths like DDoS attacks and CDN hiccups, but the plot thickened.
- **16:00 (UTC):** Like a detective in a noir film, we explored the dark alleys of potential external threats, only to find a disco ball and no real danger.
- **16:30 (UTC):** Finally, we called in the Load Balancing team, suspecting a clandestine dance-off.
- **17:00 (UTC):** Discovered the servers had indeed been doing the cha-cha without an invitation - misconfigured load balancing algorithm revealed.
- **17:15 (UTC):** Put an end to the unscheduled dance party by fixing the load balancing algorithm - servers begrudgingly returned to their seats.
- **17:45 (UTC):** Normalcy resumed; servers promised they wouldn't pull a stunt like this again.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
In a plot twist worthy of a telenovela, the servers were caught up in a misconfigured load balancing algorithm, leading to an erratic "Traffic Tango." The algorithm favored certain servers, turning our data center into a dance floor, with some servers showing off, while others were left twiddling their thumbs. The resolution? We reconfigured the load balancing algorithm to teach our servers that synchronized dancing is for flash mobs, not data centers.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
**To Improve/Fix:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Implement regular audits of load balancing configurations, ensuring they don't moonlight as dance choreographies.
2. **Automated Load Testing:** Create automated load tests to simulate user traffic, ensuring our servers are prepared for a performance party.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Upgrade our monitoring tools to superhero status, providing faster insights into server performance - saving the day before latency has a chance to pirouette.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audit:** Schedule a routine check-up for our load balancer configurations - they need regular health check-ins, just like your favorite dance partner.
2. **Documentation Update:** Sprinkle some humor in our documentation, making it as entertaining as a stand-up comedy show, while emphasizing the importance of load balancing equilibrium.
3. **Training:** Host a crash course in "Server Stand-Up Comedy" to teach our teams the art of interpreting monitoring alerts with a dash of humor.
4. **Incident Response Drill:** Organize a simulation of a "Traffic Tango" so that our teams can practice their dance moves and respond swiftly to prevent future impromptu performances.

This readme invites you to join us in the backstage drama of our servers' unscheduled "Traffic Tango." As we sweep away the confetti and glitter, rest assured, we're putting measures in place to keep our servers focused on providing a smooth, uninterrupted streaming experience. No more dance parties without an invitation!
